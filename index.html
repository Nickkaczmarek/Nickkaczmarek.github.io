         	<p>My wife has been making pumpkin pies lately from the little pie pumpkins you get at the grocery store. Normally we‚Äôd buy canned, but thought fresh would be better. I‚Äôve heard the large ones have no flavor really, but assumed the little ones would. And they do, but not as much as you‚Äôd think.</p>

<p>I was especially curious why the canned pumpkin was so much darker. After doing a little research I learned that much of canned pumpkin is actually another squash called Dickinson pumpkin. It‚Äôs huge and kind of pale orange/yellow.</p>

<p>Maybe everyone knows this, but I was a little surprised. I‚Äôll still continue to purchase pie pumpkins, but now I really want to try a Dickinson pumpkin.</p>

<p>This was a really interesting read about debugging using REPLs. Two more to add to the list are:</p>

<ul>
<li>.NET using visual studio‚Äôs immediate mode (I think that‚Äôs what it‚Äôs called)</li>
<li>LLDB in Xcode (and probably outside of Xcode too).</li>
</ul>

<p>I am a huge proponent of using the <code>debugger</code> statement in JavaScript. Debugging allows you to be able to see something at a moment in time and also inspect and execute other things. It‚Äôs like freezing time. I am generally not a fan of print statement debugging, but I recognize that sometimes you have to do what you have to do. ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</p>

         	<p>I was on a bit of a Wikipedia spiral (I do this often) and wanted to share something I found. It‚Äôs a bit of a windy story, but hopefully you find it interesting and get the bug to read about history.</p>
<p>¬†</p>
<p>Yesterday I was reading about a town in England called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackpool">Blackpool</a>. I thought the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackpool#Toponymy">name</a> was interesting and was also curious what the ‚Äòpool‚Äô part meant. This led to me reading about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bog">bogs</a>. They really are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Koitj√§rve_raba_05-2015.jpg">interesting</a>.</p>
<p>I noticed an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bog#/media/File:NSGEwM.jpg">image</a> of a bog in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Frisia">Ostfriesland</a>. I know that Austria‚Äôs name in German is √ñsterreich so I was curious what that word meant.</p>
<p>This led me to an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Ostfriesland_Verkehr-de.svg">image</a> of a map of northern Germany and all the islands that are just off the coast.</p>
<p>This led me to opening Maps and poking around to see what else was there and I found that there are a ton of islands in that area of the North Sea around the border of Denmark and Germany. Looking at the map I found an island called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heligoland">Helgoland</a> (Helgoland is the German spelling) and decided to look that up.</p>
<p>I read that this island was part of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Bight">bight</a>. A word I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve encountered before. Looking up what the German bight was informative and led me to an image of the mouth of the Elbe with an island called Trischen visible. Really beautiful photo shot by Vincent van Zeijst.¬†<br /><br /><img title="UntitledImage.png" src="https://www.nickkaczmarek.com/uploads/2021/f07964f222.png" alt="The mouth of the river Elbe, here in October 2010, marks the southeastern corner of the German Bight. The island is Trischen by Vincent van Zeijst" width="279" height="420" border="0" /></p>
<p>This image led me to the island which led me to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_of_Meldorf">Bay of Meldorf</a> which led me to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Hemmingstedt">Battle of Hemmingstedt</a>¬†(Read about this!!!) which led me to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalmar_Union">Kalmar Union</a> which led me to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanseatic_League">Hanseatic League</a> which led me to this painting of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Giese">Georg Giese</a> by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Holbein_the_Younger">Hans Holbein the Younger</a>. I was struck by how realistic this painting was. Reminds me of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnolfini_Portrait">Arnolfini Portrait by Jan van Eyck</a> with it‚Äôs extreme levels of detail.</p>
<p><img title="georggiese.png" src="https://www.nickkaczmarek.com/uploads/2021/01b94df9d2.png" alt="Hans Holbein der J√ºngere - Der Kaufmann Georg Gisze" width="368" height="420" border="0" /></p>
<p>Turns out Hans Holbein the Younger painted more than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Holbein_the_Younger">once</a>!</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Holbein_the_Younger#/media/File:Hans_Holbein_the_Younger_-_Charles_de_Solier,_Sieur_de_Morette_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg">Here‚Äôs another one I really liked</a>. This is from 1534!¬†</p>

<p>There isn‚Äôt much of a point to this post beyond I am very easily drawn to reading things on Wikipedia and this painter was incredibly talented.¬†</p>

         	<p>I was discussing with my wife whether we should bathe our baby last night.<br />I did a quick smell test and she smelled fine.<br />My wife said that her hands are filthy and she‚Äôd need a bath.<br />I said how filthy could they be, she can‚Äôt even grab anything.<br />I was so wrong.<br />I was so so so so wrong.<br />But damn is she cute.<br />Moral of the story, don‚Äôt smell an infant‚Äôs hands.<br />They are filthy.<br />Though they did smell nice after a good scrubbing.¬†</p>

         	<p>I‚Äôm always surprised that every programmer isn‚Äôt a skilled terminal user. Perhaps it‚Äôs because I got into programming after finally being able to purchase a MacBook, but having no idea what to do with it, I searched for ‚Äúterminal hacks‚Äù online and the rest is history.</p>

<p>I very much prefer to use the terminal for lots of tool things like git and basic Unix stuff. I do use a text editor though. Occasionally I‚Äôll use vim but I‚Äôm not a magician.</p>

<p>I‚Äôve seen many of my coworkers reach for a graphical git client and for some reason this surprises me over and over. I‚Äôm not shaming anyone. Just observing.</p>

<p>I wonder if they are surprised when they see me typing away on that black screen, chaining stuff together?</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>I‚Äôve been working with my brother on his photography website for a few years and it‚Äôs changed a lot over time.¬†</p>
<p>My first iteration was to take all the photos he sent me and make a basic website that displays them, using static html and css.</p>
<p>The next thing I tried was to store them in Firebase and then sort of dynamically pull in the images and import them into the same structure.</p>
<p>Then I learned about react.js and decided that I could try that out and build up his site. That was a pretty interesting experience and I learned a lot.</p>
<p>Unfortunately all of that took a lot of time and required me to basically build a CMS on my own. While I could probably do that, I realized over time that I didn‚Äôt want to and furthermore couldn‚Äôt devote the time to give him what he wanted. So I made the tough, üòÇ, decision to make him a SquareSpace website.</p>
<p>I‚Äôve been listening to ads for them in podcasts for years and finally decided it was worth it. Why should I keep him from updating his stuff because I wasn‚Äôt feeling the dev process. For the last 4 weekends, I‚Äôve helped him work on the site and I have to say that it‚Äôs a great experience.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs still the early stages, but I‚Äôm glad I had this journey. I learned a lot of web stuff that has made me a better developer and I‚Äôve also learned when to be pragmatic. I‚Äôm glad I can help him get his stuff out there and I can still provide technical assistance.¬†</p>
