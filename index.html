<p>I got off a little early this past Friday and we decided to take a trip to Bombay Food Junkies. It&rsquo;s a vegan indian restaurant in Creve Coeur, MO that has an amazing selection of food. We had taken a trip there a few weeks ago for an ice cream social and had the chance to try their wings, milkshakes, and sundaes. Everything was amazing we couldn&rsquo;t wait to go back!</p>

<p>Last time we tried the buffalo wings, the chocolate milkshake, and the brownie sundae. This time we tried the mango habanero wings, the butter chicken with naan, the buffalo chicken sandwich with masala fries, and of course the brownie sundae. All I can say is wow. I can&rsquo;t wait to go back. This weekend. üëÄ</p>

			 <p>Finally made my own salsa verde. For about $7 I made 32 oz of salsa. Comparing this to the 16 oz jars of salsa I buy for $4 it&rsquo;s a huge win. Less waste, better taste. I&rsquo;ll fine tune this as I go, but I&rsquo;m happy with the results.</p>

			 <p>Delicious bowl of lentil chili that my wife made. She also made cashew sour cream and cornbread to go with it. Absolutely amazing! Picture is a little messy, but I added more cayenne and chili powder, violife cheddar, nutritional yeast, and the cashew sour cream. I also ended up crumbling a little bit of corn tortilla chips in, but didn&rsquo;t take a picture of that or the cornbread. üå∂üåΩü´ò</p>

<p>This is one way to add a dark or light theme to your website. I use <a href="https://micro.blog">Micro.blog</a> for my website, but this should be the same for basically any website hosting service or static website that one would use.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Caveat:</strong> while I work as a software engineer and have spent many years building web code, I don&rsquo;t know everything so some of the nitty gritty details might be wrong, but the code will make your website gain the ability to display a light and dark mode.</p>

<p><strong>Important note:</strong> I may say theme here, but what I really mean is this is how you can set your website to automatically change colors based on the device&rsquo;s settings. In macOS this is called appearance (found in System Preferences -&gt; General -&gt; Appearance). In windows they call it colors (found in Settings -&gt; Personalize -&gt; Colors) and I have no idea what Linux distributions call it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="#code">tl;dr (too long; didn&rsquo;t read. take me to the code)</a></p>

<h1 id="how-to-do-the-thing">How to do the thing</h1>

<p>Finally, how to do the thing.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This tutorial assumes you know a little bit about html and css or at the very least can use a search engine to find the relevant details if I miss something. I&rsquo;ll do my best to cover it all and provide links.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Open either your website&rsquo;s main html file or main css file.</p>

<p>Figure out what your <code>background-color</code> and <code>color</code> are in the css. If you haven&rsquo;t set them that&rsquo;s fine too. By default the background color of your website will be unset which will likely render as white or <code>#fff</code> in hex and your foreground color will likely be black or <code>#000</code> in hex.  (Hex colors are one way to define colors in css, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value/color_keywords#list_of_all_color_keywords">but there are a group of named colors as well</a>.)</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> color refers to text or foreground <code>color</code> and <code>background-color</code> refers to&hellip;background color.
The below code snippet will leave your background as white and set your foreground color to gray. It will also set your font to the apple system font, but feel free to put whatever you want there. You&rsquo;ll notice there are a bunch of fonts separated by commas. Those are fallbacks in case the first one isn&rsquo;t present.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Assuming you&rsquo;re starting with an un-styled light mode website, you&rsquo;re going to put your colors from the above step in a chunk of code that will either live in your css file or in a <code>&lt;style&gt;&lt;/style&gt;</code> tag in your html.</p>

<h1 id="code">Code</h1>

<h2 id="starter-light-mode">Starter light mode</h2>

<pre><code class="language-css">@media (prefers-color-scheme: light) {
  html {
    color: #555;
    font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto,
      Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji',
      'Segoe UI Symbol';
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p><img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="https://www.nickkaczmarek.com/uploads/2022/434f043547.png" alt="Screenshot of gray text on a white background" title="Screen Shot 2022-07-07 at 21.57.25.png" border="0" width="76" height="65" /></p>

<p>Next you&rsquo;ll add a dark theme. You can choose whatever colors you want for background and foreground, but for simplicity I&rsquo;ll stick with black (#000) for the background and white (#fff) for the foreground. Keep in mind that black background and white text is a bit intense to look at so feel free to mess with these colors. I&rsquo;ve included the <code>font-family</code> attribute in both snippets, but you don&rsquo;t need it in both or either unless you plan on setting a different font when in dark mode versus light mode.</p>

<p>There are likely other elements that you&rsquo;ll want to include in your dark mode styles (like <code>pre</code> or <code>code</code>) that will look weird if you only have body styled, but I&rsquo;ll leave that as an exercise for the reader.</p>

<h2 id="starter-dark-mode">Starter dark mode</h2>

<pre><code class="language-css">@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  html {
    background-color: #000;
    color: #fff;
    font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto,
      Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji',
      'Segoe UI Symbol';
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p><img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="https://www.nickkaczmarek.com/uploads/2022/db2dd09dce.png" alt="Screenshot of white text on a black background" title="Screen Shot 2022-07-07 at 22.20.27.png" border="0" width="78" height="57" /></p>

<h1 id="ending-thoughts">Ending thoughts</h1>

<p>I wrote probably way more than I needed to for what amounts to less than 20 lines of css, but I wanted to give some background and context.</p>

<p>My inspiration for doing this to my website was browsing the web at night and being blinded by other&rsquo;s websites. I wanted to be able to make my website not to searing and I made this post to hopefully share this information with others. At the end of the day you can take the two snippets and put them on your website and you&rsquo;ll enable the ability to have two different themes for your site that follow what the operating system is rendering in terms of appearance.</p>

<p>You can also get much more creative and have a number of themes, but you&rsquo;ll likely need some sort of javascript to enable something like that. Maybe I&rsquo;ll write about that in the future. Who knows.</p>

<p>If you enjoyed this post, feel free to leave a comment or let me know on <a href="https://twitter.com/nickkacz/">twitter @nickkacz</a> or if you use micro.blog (I hope you do) send me a mention there. I&rsquo;d love to hear about it or what I could do to help.</p>

<p>&ndash; Nick</p>

<h1 id="my-theme">My theme</h1>

<p>And finally this is what my dark theme looks like:</p>

<pre><code class="language-css">@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  html {
    background-color: #000;
    color: #b4b4b4;
    font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto,
      Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji',
      'Segoe UI Symbol';
  }
  .site__name {
    color: #b4b4b4;
  }
  pre {
    background-color: #282828;
    color: #b4b4b4;
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>And here is my light theme:</p>

<pre><code class="language-css">@media (prefers-color-scheme: light) {
  html {
    color: #555;
    font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto,
      Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji',
      'Segoe UI Symbol';
  }
}
</code></pre>

			 <p>I haven&rsquo;t been blogging for very long, but I was very curious about who (if anyone) might be seeing my site. So I looked around a little for an analytics platform I could use that would respect user privacy. I found one called Plausible Analytics that looked really nice, but I didn&rsquo;t want to pay anything (I know, I know) and I also didn&rsquo;t want to host anything (which also costs money). I eventually found something called <a href="https://www.goatcounter.com">GoatCounter</a> and it seems like it&rsquo;s just the right tool for the job.</p>

<p>I am shocked to find that not only do people see my site, but apparently it&rsquo;s more than 1 or 2. From March 31 until now (June 6th), I&rsquo;ve received 91 page views!? That&rsquo;s peanuts compared to more established people but I&rsquo;m pretty happy to learn this.</p>

<p>Something really nice about GoatCounter is that it gives you pretty basic data about who/what is seeing your site. Because I chose something that doesn&rsquo;t want to infringe on user&rsquo;s privacy, I can only see browsers, referrers, systems (OSes), device categories (Phones, Large phones, etc.), country of origin, and language. This is a lot, but I am still so curious who is seeing my site.</p>

<p>I doubt many will see this post, but if you&rsquo;re bored send me an email at nick.s.kaczmarek@gmail.com and say hello. You can also tweet at me at @nickkacz. If I&rsquo;ve written anything helpful or useful, I&rsquo;d love to hear from you.</p>

<p>From what I can tell if doesn&rsquo;t really matter and you can still commit just fine (in the terminal if you want to use GPG), but it was annoying me. So I went spelunking and found <a href="https://github.com/isaacs/github/issues/675#issuecomment-219521841">this post on GitHub</a>. In the post the author shares a git config command we can use to solve the issue.</p>

<pre><code>git config --global gpg.program $(which gpg)
</code></pre>

<p>Run this in your terminal and then when you create a project in Xcode, the warning should go away. Expect that you&rsquo;ll need to enter your GPG password (if you have one) on the next project creation.</p>

<p>For reference, <a href="https://gist.github.com/koshatul/2427643668d4e89c0086f297f9ed2130">here is the gist</a> I followed to set up my GPG key for macOS.</p>

			 <p>I was trying to install an app (MS Teams) but was seeing a strange message from the installer:</p>

<pre><code>waiting for other installations to complete
</code></pre>

<p>I found something on <a href="https://superuser.com/a/321627">stackoverflow.com</a> on how to fix it and it worked like a charm:</p>

<pre><code class="language-shell">sudo killall -1 installd
</code></pre>

<p>Note: I did not run the command to remove any locked files, just filled the process and tried the install again.</p>

<p>Hopefully this helps someone else (or future me).</p>

<p>I have used VSCode for much of my career (for historical .NETy reasons) and really like its ability to split editor panes. Particularly the ability to split horizontally and vertically. I was bummed when moving to Xcode and found I wasn&rsquo;t able to do this&hellip;Until now!</p>

<h2 id="how-to-do-split-editor-vertically-in-xcode">How to do split editor vertically in Xcode</h2>

<ol>
<li>Open Xcode (seems like it has to be a project, not a playground)</li>
<li>Go to File -&gt; New -&gt; Editor Below (ctrl + option + cmd + T)
<img src="https://www.nickkaczmarek.com/uploads/2022/2cc5fa4c1c.png" alt="macOS Xcode menu with Editor Below highlighted" title="Screen Shot 2022-04-08 at 13.20.04.png" border="0" width="220" height="300" /></li>
</ol>

<p>This is very exciting, but I look forward to when other editors support the VSCode feature of dragging those pane corners more than one direction at a time. (VSCode allows you to grab at the corner of two panes and drag horizontally, vertically, or diagonally all in one motion while Xcode and Nova only allow one direction per click).</p>

			 <p>I use an app called <a href="https://redsweater.com/marsedit/">MarsEdit</a> to author my blog posts. I really like it and I recommend anyone using a Mac to check it out. Great piece of indie developed software that just works.</p>

<p>Something cool that it enables is the ability to preview your post in the style of your blog. The template that comes with the app isn&rsquo;t bad but of course it likely doesn&rsquo;t match your site. In the past I&rsquo;ve gone into the web inspector in Safari and took the html for my site and put it into the preview template.</p>

<p>I just learned however that MarsEdit has the ability to download a preview template from your website. I clicked the button and ~10 seconds later I have a preview of my site that just works. What an amazing feature. I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s new or not, but really appreciate the coolness factor.</p>

<p>Thanks again <a href="https://redsweater.com">Red Sweater Software</a> and <a href="https://micro.blog/danielpunkass">@danielpunkass</a>!</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve been using Universal Control since yesterday afternoon and I really love it. It&rsquo;s seamless and I especially appreciate being able to isolate certain things to the iPad. This is particularly useful because I often pair program at work and it makes it so that I can talk to my wife or whomever without having to stop sharing or share that potentially private info. I wish the iPad could enable some sort of screensaver because I have some worries about it showing the same black text on white screen for most of the workday, but it&rsquo;s not a deal breaker. If you have the means, I would highly recommend giving it a try. It feels even better because I&rsquo;m using the Magic Trackpad so I can do all the gesture things on iPadOS.</p>

			 <p>Tried the new Beyond Meat chicken nuggets from KFC because why not. Great breading, but unfortunately they were dense as hell. Another local restaurant, Sybergs, serves the beyond meat chicken tenders and while the breading isn‚Äôt as good, they are moist and juicy. It was worth the try and I‚Äôd eat if I were stuck in the middle of nowhere, but it‚Äôs about on par with the Burger King impossible whopper. Which is to say that non vegans seem to struggle with cooking non meat products.</p>

<p>What a shame because I love that there are more plant based options accessible to people who normally wouldn‚Äôt seek that out. I‚Äôm hoping this is the beginning and not the end and there is only upside from here because we really shouldn‚Äôt be raising animals for food. For many reasons.</p>

			 <p>** tl;dr you choose the map on your phone, not on the game console. **</p>

<p>I purchased Ticket to Ride on my PlayStation 4 recently after playing the board game. I wanted to play the expansions as well and particularly in local mode so I could play with my wife. When we first purchased the DLC for the game, it was unclear to us how, if it all, to play the other maps. After spending an hour or so looking into it and reading online we couldn‚Äôt find anything so we decided to try to get a refund on the DLC and just play the base game. So sad.</p>

<p>Through some sort of luck, we noticed something when playing the base game again after the refund‚Ä¶</p>

<p>A little background first.</p>

<p>When you start the game and choose local mode, the game asks you to install an app on your mobile device so that you can keep your cards to yourself. Makes sense. What we didn‚Äôt realize is that the mobile interface is actually how you choose the maps! ¬°Fant√°stico! In other play modes you choose the map with the controller so we must have missed this earlier.</p>

<p>So like any reasonable person, we bought the DLC again and we were able to play the Europe version of the game! It was so much fun and more challenging than the US map. Highly recommend this game.</p>

<p>Footnote, thanks to Sony for giving us a refund. I also reached out to the company who made the game with the same question and they never got back to me after saying they‚Äôd reach out to the engineers. Amazing that no one had this info so hopefully this post will help some other poor soul who just wants to play the train game.</p>

			 <p>Now that my daughter is six months old I feel like I have a better grasp on what being a parent is like.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs so interesting how many different opinions there are. As my friend Bill once said, ‚ÄúNick, you like to live your life on hard mode‚Äù and this is no different. Raising a baby without resorting to tv babysitting has been very interesting. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, sometimes she sees the tv but we are careful to curtail it as often as it happens. It‚Äôs more effort to spend time with her and I‚Äôm so happy and fortunate that I have this opportunity.</p>

<p>Being a parent is the most amazing thing I‚Äôve ever done and I‚Äôd do it again! If you have the means and desire, I would recommend it. Just make sure you‚Äôre ready to change your life for them. Although I think once you meet your child you‚Äôll never have a thought that contradicts that love and care. Even in the challenging moments. Maybe I‚Äôm just crazy. Maybe I‚Äôm crazy in love. I don‚Äôt know everything, but I do like being parent.</p>

<p>Important notes, I‚Äôm a reasonably well paid software engineer who gets to work from home and I make enough that my wife can afford to stay home with the baby. I recognize this is not the norm and many likely wouldn‚Äôt want to live this way, but I do and I love it. I also recognize (or try to) my privilege</p>

<p>Also I‚Äôm aware that I write like a child and this is likely rambling nonsense, but I just wanted to write something about her.</p>

I was worried that they‚Äôd be like your typical person and shudder at the idea of it, but they tried the burgers and the sausages. I was surprised how much they enjoyed them. They even said they liked the beyond meat breakfast sausages more than they like regular sausage. <br /><br />What an amazing weekend.</p>

			 <p>My wife has been making pumpkin pies lately from the little pie pumpkins you get at the grocery store. Normally we‚Äôd buy canned, but thought fresh would be better. I‚Äôve heard the large ones have no flavor really, but assumed the little ones would. And they do, but not as much as you‚Äôd think.</p>

<p>I was especially curious why the canned pumpkin was so much darker. After doing a little research I learned that much of canned pumpkin is actually another squash called Dickinson pumpkin. It‚Äôs huge and kind of pale orange/yellow.</p>

<p>Maybe everyone knows this, but I was a little surprised. I‚Äôll still continue to purchase pie pumpkins, but now I really want to try a Dickinson pumpkin.</p>

<p>This was a really interesting read about debugging using REPLs. Two more to add to the list are:</p>

<ul>
<li>.NET using visual studio‚Äôs immediate mode (I think that‚Äôs what it‚Äôs called)</li>
<li>LLDB in Xcode (and probably outside of Xcode too).</li>
</ul>

<p>I am a huge proponent of using the <code>debugger</code> statement in JavaScript. Debugging allows you to be able to see something at a moment in time and also inspect and execute other things. It‚Äôs like freezing time. I am generally not a fan of print statement debugging, but I recognize that sometimes you have to do what you have to do. ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</p>

			 <p>I was on a bit of a Wikipedia spiral (I do this often) and wanted to share something I found. It‚Äôs a bit of a windy story, but hopefully you find it interesting and get the bug to read about history.</p>
<p>¬†</p>
<p>Yesterday I was reading about a town in England called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackpool">Blackpool</a>. I thought the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackpool#Toponymy">name</a> was interesting and was also curious what the ‚Äòpool‚Äô part meant. This led to me reading about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bog">bogs</a>. They really are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Koitj√§rve_raba_05-2015.jpg">interesting</a>.</p>
<p>I noticed an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bog#/media/File:NSGEwM.jpg">image</a> of a bog in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Frisia">Ostfriesland</a>. I know that Austria‚Äôs name in German is √ñsterreich so I was curious what that word meant.</p>
<p>This led me to an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Ostfriesland_Verkehr-de.svg">image</a> of a map of northern Germany and all the islands that are just off the coast.</p>
<p>This led me to opening Maps and poking around to see what else was there and I found that there are a ton of islands in that area of the North Sea around the border of Denmark and Germany. Looking at the map I found an island called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heligoland">Helgoland</a> (Helgoland is the German spelling) and decided to look that up.</p>
<p>I read that this island was part of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Bight">bight</a>. A word I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve encountered before. Looking up what the German bight was informative and led me to an image of the mouth of the Elbe with an island called Trischen visible. Really beautiful photo shot by Vincent van Zeijst.¬†<br /><br /><img title="UntitledImage.png" src="https://www.nickkaczmarek.com/uploads/2021/f07964f222.png" alt="The mouth of the river Elbe, here in October 2010, marks the southeastern corner of the German Bight. The island is Trischen by Vincent van Zeijst" width="279" height="420" border="0" /></p>
<p>This image led me to the island which led me to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_of_Meldorf">Bay of Meldorf</a> which led me to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Hemmingstedt">Battle of Hemmingstedt</a>¬†(Read about this!!!) which led me to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalmar_Union">Kalmar Union</a> which led me to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanseatic_League">Hanseatic League</a> which led me to this painting of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Giese">Georg Giese</a> by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Holbein_the_Younger">Hans Holbein the Younger</a>. I was struck by how realistic this painting was. Reminds me of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnolfini_Portrait">Arnolfini Portrait by Jan van Eyck</a> with it‚Äôs extreme levels of detail.</p>
<p><img title="georggiese.png" src="https://www.nickkaczmarek.com/uploads/2021/01b94df9d2.png" alt="Hans Holbein der J√ºngere - Der Kaufmann Georg Gisze" width="368" height="420" border="0" /></p>
<p>Turns out Hans Holbein the Younger painted more than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Holbein_the_Younger">once</a>!</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Holbein_the_Younger#/media/File:Hans_Holbein_the_Younger_-_Charles_de_Solier,_Sieur_de_Morette_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg">Here‚Äôs another one I really liked</a>. This is from 1534!¬†</p>
<p><img title="charlesdesolier.png" src="https://www.nickkaczmarek.com/uploads/2021/965435e9d8.png" alt="Charles de Solier, Sieur de Morette, 1534. Gem√§ldegalerie Alte Meister, Dresden." width="420" height="528" border="0" /></p>
<p>There isn‚Äôt much of a point to this post beyond I am very easily drawn to reading things on Wikipedia and this painter was incredibly talented.¬†</p>

			 <p>I‚Äôm always surprised that every programmer isn‚Äôt a skilled terminal user. Perhaps it‚Äôs because I got into programming after finally being able to purchase a MacBook, but having no idea what to do with it, I searched for ‚Äúterminal hacks‚Äù online and the rest is history.</p>

<p>I very much prefer to use the terminal for lots of tool things like git and basic Unix stuff. I do use a text editor though. Occasionally I‚Äôll use vim but I‚Äôm not a magician.</p>

<p>I‚Äôve seen many of my coworkers reach for a graphical git client and for some reason this surprises me over and over. I‚Äôm not shaming anyone. Just observing.</p>

<p>I wonder if they are surprised when they see me typing away on that black screen, chaining stuff together?</p>

			 <p>I‚Äôve been working with my brother on his photography website for a few years and it‚Äôs changed a lot over time.¬†</p>
<p>My first iteration was to take all the photos he sent me and make a basic website that displays them, using static html and css.</p>
<p>The next thing I tried was to store them in Firebase and then sort of dynamically pull in the images and import them into the same structure.</p>
<p>Then I learned about react.js and decided that I could try that out and build up his site. That was a pretty interesting experience and I learned a lot.</p>
<p>Unfortunately all of that took a lot of time and required me to basically build a CMS on my own. While I could probably do that, I realized over time that I didn‚Äôt want to and furthermore couldn‚Äôt devote the time to give him what he wanted. So I made the tough, üòÇ, decision to make him a SquareSpace website.</p>
<p>I‚Äôve been listening to ads for them in podcasts for years and finally decided it was worth it. Why should I keep him from updating his stuff because I wasn‚Äôt feeling the dev process. For the last 4 weekends, I‚Äôve helped him work on the site and I have to say that it‚Äôs a great experience.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs still the early stages, but I‚Äôm glad I had this journey. I learned a lot of web stuff that has made me a better developer and I‚Äôve also learned when to be pragmatic. I‚Äôm glad I can help him get his stuff out there and I can still provide technical assistance.¬†</p>

			 <p>Hi, I‚Äôm Nick. <br /><br />I‚Äôm a software engineer living in Saint Louis, Missouri. I‚Äôve been working in the web space, writing .NET and JavaScript apps for about five years. I‚Äôm very interested in iOS and macOS development so that‚Äôs what I‚Äôll be talking about and posting here.</p>
<p>I started a blog at nickkaczmarek.com, but I‚Äôll be slowly moving over here. I only have two or three posts there so that shouldn‚Äôt be tough.</p>
