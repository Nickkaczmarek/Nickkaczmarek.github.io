         	<p>Success! Air fryer rolled tacos! Took me a couple days of trial and error (and tostadas), but we did it. And my wife liked them too. I haven’t had rolled tacos in years so this was quite it nostalgic moment for me.</p>

I made this in the instant pot so had to adapt a little more but came out great. Also made some basmati rice and simmered mustard and cumin seed in oil and cooked that with the rice.

         	<p>Tostadas con frijoles y arroz Mexicano. I intended to make rolled tacos but made my beans too runny so we decided to air fry tortillas to make tostadas. They came out amazing! My wife also made a cheese sauce from @ohsheglows cookbook. As always the rice is @morenita.salazar.k recipe but I’ve adapted it over time to be vegan. The tostadas have beans, lettuce, tomatoes, pickled jalapeños, cheese sauce, salsa verde, @herdezmexico chipotle cremosa (holy shit this stuff is good), and cashew sour cream. These were next level.</p>

         	<p>Tried the new Beyond Meat chicken nuggets from KFC because why not. Great breading, but unfortunately they were dense as hell. Another local restaurant, Sybergs, serves the beyond meat chicken tenders and while the breading isn’t as good, they are moist and juicy. It was worth the try and I’d eat if I were stuck in the middle of nowhere, but it’s about on par with the Burger King impossible whopper. Which is to say that non vegans seem to struggle with cooking non meat products.</p>

<p>What a shame because I love that there are more plant based options accessible to people who normally wouldn’t seek that out. I’m hoping this is the beginning and not the end and there is only upside from here because we really shouldn’t be raising animals for food. For many reasons.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>** tl;dr you choose the map on your phone, not on the game console. **</p>

<p>I purchased Ticket to Ride on my PlayStation 4 recently after playing the board game. I wanted to play the expansions as well and particularly in local mode so I could play with my wife. When we first purchased the DLC for the game, it was unclear to us how, if it all, to play the other maps. After spending an hour or so looking into it and reading online we couldn’t find anything so we decided to try to get a refund on the DLC and just play the base game. So sad.</p>

<p>Through some sort of luck, we noticed something when playing the base game again after the refund…</p>

<p>A little background first.</p>

<p>When you start the game and choose local mode, the game asks you to install an app on your mobile device so that you can keep your cards to yourself. Makes sense. What we didn’t realize is that the mobile interface is actually how you choose the maps! ¡Fantástico! In other play modes you choose the map with the controller so we must have missed this earlier.</p>

<p>So like any reasonable person, we bought the DLC again and we were able to play the Europe version of the game! It was so much fun and more challenging than the US map. Highly recommend this game.</p>

<p>Footnote, thanks to Sony for giving us a refund. I also reached out to the company who made the game with the same question and they never got back to me after saying they’d reach out to the engineers. Amazing that no one had this info so hopefully this post will help some other poor soul who just wants to play the train game.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Now that my daughter is six months old I feel like I have a better grasp on what being a parent is like.</p>

<p>It’s so interesting how many different opinions there are. As my friend Bill once said, “Nick, you like to live your life on hard mode” and this is no different. Raising a baby without resorting to tv babysitting has been very interesting. Don’t get me wrong, sometimes she sees the tv but we are careful to curtail it as often as it happens. It’s more effort to spend time with her and I’m so happy and fortunate that I have this opportunity.</p>

<p>Being a parent is the most amazing thing I’ve ever done and I’d do it again! If you have the means and desire, I would recommend it. Just make sure you’re ready to change your life for them. Although I think once you meet your child you’ll never have a thought that contradicts that love and care. Even in the challenging moments. Maybe I’m just crazy. Maybe I’m crazy in love. I don’t know everything, but I do like being parent.</p>

<p>Important notes, I’m a reasonably well paid software engineer who gets to work from home and I make enough that my wife can afford to stay home with the baby. I recognize this is not the norm and many likely wouldn’t want to live this way, but I do and I love it. I also recognize (or try to) my privilege</p>

<p>Also I’m aware that I write like a child and this is likely rambling nonsense, but I just wanted to write something about her.</p>

         	<p>My wife has been making pumpkin pies lately from the little pie pumpkins you get at the grocery store. Normally we’d buy canned, but thought fresh would be better. I’ve heard the large ones have no flavor really, but assumed the little ones would. And they do, but not as much as you’d think.</p>

<p>I was especially curious why the canned pumpkin was so much darker. After doing a little research I learned that much of canned pumpkin is actually another squash called Dickinson pumpkin. It’s huge and kind of pale orange/yellow.</p>

<p>Maybe everyone knows this, but I was a little surprised. I’ll still continue to purchase pie pumpkins, but now I really want to try a Dickinson pumpkin.</p>

<p>This was a really interesting read about debugging using REPLs. Two more to add to the list are:</p>

<ul>
<li>.NET using visual studio’s immediate mode (I think that’s what it’s called)</li>
<li>LLDB in Xcode (and probably outside of Xcode too).</li>
</ul>

<p>I am a huge proponent of using the <code>debugger</code> statement in JavaScript. Debugging allows you to be able to see something at a moment in time and also inspect and execute other things. It’s like freezing time. I am generally not a fan of print statement debugging, but I recognize that sometimes you have to do what you have to do. 🤷🏽‍♂️</p>

         	<p>I was on a bit of a Wikipedia spiral (I do this often) and wanted to share something I found. It’s a bit of a windy story, but hopefully you find it interesting and get the bug to read about history.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Yesterday I was reading about a town in England called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackpool">Blackpool</a>. I thought the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackpool#Toponymy">name</a> was interesting and was also curious what the ‘pool’ part meant. This led to me reading about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bog">bogs</a>. They really are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Koitjärve_raba_05-2015.jpg">interesting</a>.</p>
<p>I noticed an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bog#/media/File:NSGEwM.jpg">image</a> of a bog in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Frisia">Ostfriesland</a>. I know that Austria’s name in German is Österreich so I was curious what that word meant.</p>
<p>This led me to an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Ostfriesland_Verkehr-de.svg">image</a> of a map of northern Germany and all the islands that are just off the coast.</p>
<p>This led me to opening Maps and poking around to see what else was there and I found that there are a ton of islands in that area of the North Sea around the border of Denmark and Germany. Looking at the map I found an island called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heligoland">Helgoland</a> (Helgoland is the German spelling) and decided to look that up.</p>
<p>I read that this island was part of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Bight">bight</a>. A word I don’t think I’ve encountered before. Looking up what the German bight was informative and led me to an image of the mouth of the Elbe with an island called Trischen visible. Really beautiful photo shot by Vincent van Zeijst. <br /><br /><img title="UntitledImage.png" src="https://www.nickkaczmarek.com/uploads/2021/f07964f222.png" alt="The mouth of the river Elbe, here in October 2010, marks the southeastern corner of the German Bight. The island is Trischen by Vincent van Zeijst" width="279" height="420" border="0" /></p>
<p>This image led me to the island which led me to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_of_Meldorf">Bay of Meldorf</a> which led me to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Hemmingstedt">Battle of Hemmingstedt</a> (Read about this!!!) which led me to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalmar_Union">Kalmar Union</a> which led me to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanseatic_League">Hanseatic League</a> which led me to this painting of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Giese">Georg Giese</a> by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Holbein_the_Younger">Hans Holbein the Younger</a>. I was struck by how realistic this painting was. Reminds me of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnolfini_Portrait">Arnolfini Portrait by Jan van Eyck</a> with it’s extreme levels of detail.</p>
<p><img title="georggiese.png" src="https://www.nickkaczmarek.com/uploads/2021/01b94df9d2.png" alt="Hans Holbein der Jüngere - Der Kaufmann Georg Gisze" width="368" height="420" border="0" /></p>
<p>Turns out Hans Holbein the Younger painted more than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Holbein_the_Younger">once</a>!</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Holbein_the_Younger#/media/File:Hans_Holbein_the_Younger_-_Charles_de_Solier,_Sieur_de_Morette_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg">Here’s another one I really liked</a>. This is from 1534! </p>
<p><img title="charlesdesolier.png" src="https://www.nickkaczmarek.com/uploads/2021/965435e9d8.png" alt="Charles de Solier, Sieur de Morette, 1534. Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister, Dresden." width="420" height="528" border="0" /></p>
<p>There isn’t much of a point to this post beyond I am very easily drawn to reading things on Wikipedia and this painter was incredibly talented. </p>

         	<p>Bit late, but I really don’t understand all the hate for the Apple TV 4 remote. The one with the square touch pad. I almost never accidentally click the touch pad or lose it or anything. I’m sure the new remote is better, but I still don’t understand how there is so much hate.</p>

         	<p>I’m always surprised that every programmer isn’t a skilled terminal user. Perhaps it’s because I got into programming after finally being able to purchase a MacBook, but having no idea what to do with it, I searched for “terminal hacks” online and the rest is history.</p>

<p>I very much prefer to use the terminal for lots of tool things like git and basic Unix stuff. I do use a text editor though. Occasionally I’ll use vim but I’m not a magician.</p>

<p>I’ve seen many of my coworkers reach for a graphical git client and for some reason this surprises me over and over. I’m not shaming anyone. Just observing.</p>

<p>I wonder if they are surprised when they see me typing away on that black screen, chaining stuff together?</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>I’ve been working with my brother on his photography website for a few years and it’s changed a lot over time. </p>
<p>My first iteration was to take all the photos he sent me and make a basic website that displays them, using static html and css.</p>
<p>The next thing I tried was to store them in Firebase and then sort of dynamically pull in the images and import them into the same structure.</p>
<p>Then I learned about react.js and decided that I could try that out and build up his site. That was a pretty interesting experience and I learned a lot.</p>
<p>Unfortunately all of that took a lot of time and required me to basically build a CMS on my own. While I could probably do that, I realized over time that I didn’t want to and furthermore couldn’t devote the time to give him what he wanted. So I made the tough, 😂, decision to make him a SquareSpace website.</p>
<p>I’ve been listening to ads for them in podcasts for years and finally decided it was worth it. Why should I keep him from updating his stuff because I wasn’t feeling the dev process. For the last 4 weekends, I’ve helped him work on the site and I have to say that it’s a great experience.</p>
<p>It’s still the early stages, but I’m glad I had this journey. I learned a lot of web stuff that has made me a better developer and I’ve also learned when to be pragmatic. I’m glad I can help him get his stuff out there and I can still provide technical assistance. </p>
