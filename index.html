        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>I’m always surprised that every programmer isn’t a skilled terminal user. Perhaps it’s because I got into programming after finally being able to purchase a MacBook, but having no idea what to do with it, I searched for “terminal hacks” online and the rest is history.</p>

<p>I very much prefer to use the terminal for lots of tool things like git and basic Unix stuff. I do use a text editor though. Occasionally I’ll use vim but I’m not a magician.</p>

<p>I’ve seen many of my coworkers reach for a graphical git client and for some reason this surprises me over and over. I’m not shaming anyone. Just observing.</p>

<p>I wonder if they are surprised when they see me typing away on that black screen, chaining stuff together?</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>I’ve been working with my brother on his photography website for a few years and it’s changed a lot over time. </p>
<p>My first iteration was to take all the photos he sent me and make a basic website that displays them, using static html and css.</p>
<p>The next thing I tried was to store them in Firebase and then sort of dynamically pull in the images and import them into the same structure.</p>
<p>Then I learned about react.js and decided that I could try that out and build up his site. That was a pretty interesting experience and I learned a lot.</p>
<p>Unfortunately all of that took a lot of time and required me to basically build a CMS on my own. While I could probably do that, I realized over time that I didn’t want to and furthermore couldn’t devote the time to give him what he wanted. So I made the tough, 😂, decision to make him a SquareSpace website.</p>
<p>I’ve been listening to ads for them in podcasts for years and finally decided it was worth it. Why should I keep him from updating his stuff because I wasn’t feeling the dev process. For the last 4 weekends, I’ve helped him work on the site and I have to say that it’s a great experience.</p>
<p>It’s still the early stages, but I’m glad I had this journey. I learned a lot of web stuff that has made me a better developer and I’ve also learned when to be pragmatic. I’m glad I can help him get his stuff out there and I can still provide technical assistance. </p>

         	<p>Hi, I’m Nick. <br /><br />I’m a software engineer living in Saint Louis, Missouri. I’ve been working in the web space, writing .NET and JavaScript apps for about five years. I’m very interested in iOS and macOS development so that’s what I’ll be talking about and posting here.</p>
<p>I started a blog at nickkaczmarek.com, but I’ll be slowly moving over here. I only have two or three posts there so that shouldn’t be tough.</p>
<p>I hope you all enjoy!</p>
