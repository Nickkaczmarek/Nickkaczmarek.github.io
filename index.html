        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>I‚Äôm always surprised that every programmer isn‚Äôt a skilled terminal user. Perhaps it‚Äôs because I got into programming after finally being able to purchase a MacBook, but having no idea what to do with it, I searched for ‚Äúterminal hacks‚Äù online and the rest is history.</p>

<p>I very much prefer to use the terminal for lots of tool things like git and basic Unix stuff. I do use a text editor though. Occasionally I‚Äôll use vim but I‚Äôm not a magician.</p>

<p>I‚Äôve seen many of my coworkers reach for a graphical git client and for some reason this surprises me over and over. I‚Äôm not shaming anyone. Just observing.</p>

<p>I wonder if they are surprised when they see me typing away on that black screen, chaining stuff together?</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>I‚Äôve been working with my brother on his photography website for a few years and it‚Äôs changed a lot over time.¬†</p>
<p>My first iteration was to take all the photos he sent me and make a basic website that displays them, using static html and css.</p>
<p>The next thing I tried was to store them in Firebase and then sort of dynamically pull in the images and import them into the same structure.</p>
<p>Then I learned about react.js and decided that I could try that out and build up his site. That was a pretty interesting experience and I learned a lot.</p>
<p>Unfortunately all of that took a lot of time and required me to basically build a CMS on my own. While I could probably do that, I realized over time that I didn‚Äôt want to and furthermore couldn‚Äôt devote the time to give him what he wanted. So I made the tough, üòÇ, decision to make him a SquareSpace website.</p>
<p>I‚Äôve been listening to ads for them in podcasts for years and finally decided it was worth it. Why should I keep him from updating his stuff because I wasn‚Äôt feeling the dev process. For the last 4 weekends, I‚Äôve helped him work on the site and I have to say that it‚Äôs a great experience.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs still the early stages, but I‚Äôm glad I had this journey. I learned a lot of web stuff that has made me a better developer and I‚Äôve also learned when to be pragmatic. I‚Äôm glad I can help him get his stuff out there and I can still provide technical assistance.¬†</p>
