Although I think once you meet your child you’ll never have a thought that contradicts that love and care. Even in the challenging moments. Maybe I’m just crazy. Maybe I’m crazy in love. I don’t know everything, but I do like being parent. \n\nImportant notes, I’m a reasonably well paid software engineer who gets to work from home and I make enough that my wife can afford to stay home with the baby. I recognize this is not the norm and many likely wouldn’t want to live this way, but I do and I love it. I also recognize (or try to) my privilege \n\nAlso I’m aware that I write like a child and this is likely rambling nonsense, but I just wanted to write something about her. \n\n",
